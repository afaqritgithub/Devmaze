I am currently doing my FELLOWSHIP in DEVMAZE.
This is my first assignment.






## ASSIGNMENT 

#### Question 1: what is the difference between Procedural programming And OOP?

Answer 1: Procedural programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) are two distinct paradigms used in software development. Procedural programming relies on functions to manipulate data, while OOP utilizes classes and objects to represent entities and their behaviors.

OOP provides additional concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which enable better management of complexity and promote code reuse. Encapsulation hides data and behavior from the outside world, inheritance reduces redundancy, polymorphism enhances flexibility and modularity, and abstraction simplifies models.

OOP is often preferred for larger, more complex projects because of its ability to manage complexity and promote maintainability. However, the choice of programming paradigm should always be based on the requirements and constraints of the project at hand.




#### Question 2: what you think that we can learn in OOP?

Answer 2: In OOP, there are several fundamental concepts that developers can learn and apply to their software designs. These concepts include:

Classes and objects: OOP uses classes to define a blueprint for objects, which represent entities in the system. Developers can learn to create and use classes and objects effectively.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of hiding data and behavior within an object, making it more secure and easier to manage.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows developers to create new classes based on existing ones, which can reduce redundancy and improve code organization.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, making code more flexible and modular.

Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex models by capturing only the essential features of an entity. This can make code more maintainable and easier to understand.

By learning these concepts and applying them to their software designs, developers can create more modular, flexible, and maintainable code.
